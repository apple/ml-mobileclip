# Code Of Conduct

## Our Pledge

At Ultralytics, we are dedicated to fostering an **open, welcoming, and inclusive environment** for all contributors and maintainers. We pledge to make participation in our project and community a **harassment-free experience for everyone**, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, experience level, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

To build a positive and productive community, we expect all participants to:

- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Show respect for differing viewpoints and experiences
- Accept constructive criticism gracefully
- Focus on what benefits the community as a whole
- Demonstrate empathy towards other community members

**Unacceptable behaviors** include, but are not limited to:

- Use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information (such as physical or electronic addresses) without explicit permission
- Any other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. They may also ban, temporarily or permanently, any contributor for behaviors deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including online platforms and in-person events. It also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces. Examples of representation include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an event. Project maintainers may further define and clarify representation as needed.

For more information on project spaces and representation, see the [Ultralytics community guidelines](https://docs.ultralytics.com/help/code-of-conduct/).

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the Ultralytics team via the [Ultralytics support page](https://www.ultralytics.com/support). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly, with a response deemed appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality regarding the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
